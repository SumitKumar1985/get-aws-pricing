AWS now publishes pricing information for services via [AWS Price List](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/awsaccountbilling/latest/aboutv2/price-changes.html).
This API lets users query pricing information and can be accessed at [get-aws-pricing](https://get-aws-pricing.herokuapp.com/)

- Support for published 'offer codes' is being added, one at a time. S3 is done, EC2 is in the works. Pull requests are welcome.
- This API will be versioned once stable.
